## The coursework deadline has been moved

As of yesterday, the Psychology Teaching team and Student Services have agreed to a 48h deadline extension to give everyone a bit more time.

[PSGY4043 Submission Link - Part 1](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/calendar/view.php?view=day&course=93631&time=1585321200#event_17699142)

**Due date: Friday, 27 March, 3:00 PM**

## Additional circumstances

If any of you have extenuating circumstances (ECs), then they can still be taken into account via the usual route - for details see the [Student Services page about ECs](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studentservices/services/extenuating-circumstances.aspx)

## Alternatives for running software

The coursework involves analysing MRI data and creating plots and summaries. The suggested tools for these rely on `matlab` and/or `unix` tools.

Because access to campus will likely be restricted soon and some students may be following advice to self-isolate using the Psychology computer labs running `macOS` and the data anlysis tools I have installed there (`fsl`) is not guaranteed. **We have therefore made additional arrangements:**

Please have a look at the following information that will help you to run analyses on computers *away from the computer labs in Psychology at UNUK*.

1. **Installing FSL on your own computer** - If you want to install the `fsl` tools on your own computer have access to a computer running `macOS` or `Linux` - look at the following webpage: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation (`Windows` - it's also possible to install the tools on PCs but it may be a bit involved. You can always just rely on the pre-analysed dataset [see below] and `matlab` to make any additional figures).

2. **Installing Matlab on your own computer** - The Total Academic Headcount license from The Mathworks allows you to install a copy of `matlab` on your own computer. Log in at: https://uk.mathworks.com/ and pick a recent release. 2018a or 2019a has worked well for me (https://uk.mathworks.com/downloads/web_downloads/select_release)

3. **Alternative / Online Matlab** - If you don't have access to a desktop or laptop computer on which `matlab` can be installed, you can use the web-based version on https://matlab.mathworks.com/ (inside a web browser). There is nearly complete functionality for anything you'd want to do.

4. **Online DAFNI materials** - As always, you can find code, some examples, etc. on the `github.com` page for the module: https://github.com/schluppeck/dafni

5. **Online DAFNI materials - Matlab Drive** - I have also put a copy in the Matlab drive, so you can access this material with `Matlab online` more easily: https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/c1ff0edc-d125-4b69-94f1-e8bdfe856f65

## link to dataset

Some students may already have a copy of a dataset they can access. For those who don't - I have made the following available here for download:

- [OneDrive link to download data](https://uniofnottm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/denis_schluppeck_nottingham_ac_uk/EkVrrPclL55Mndr5m3sP9IYBkIDaDjeQpLigoUW_byTt-Q?e=3quk9w) (~350mb) You can download a copy of this to your computer ane work on it there.

- [MATLAB drive link](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/f1543e8b-3594-4aad-a807-c75ff63d1b9c) (online, useable with https://matlab.mathworks.com/). This is the same dataset, but already uploaded to *The Mathworks* MATLAB Drive, so you can use it straight from there.
